        I served as President of Glasgow University Tech Society between March 2024
        and April 2025, helping to deliver 5 social events, 2 hackathons with 200+

        I was a Class Representative for Level 1, Level 3, and Level 4 Honours Computer
        Science at Glasgow, meeting regularly with academic staff to communicate course
        feedback and encourage meaningful change.

        Whilst studying, I undertook over 100 hours of volunteering, earning me a Saltire Award from the Scottish Government ("The Ascent" tier).
        I also regularly provided academic and professional mentorship, CV review, and technical interview coaching to peers.
